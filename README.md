Playing around with AI and transcribed voice notes within a Notion project

## Problem

I find myself being unable to turn off my brain sometimes and not always in a position to write things down (aka daily walks to the gym, playing basketball, driving etc.)

## Goal

I'd like to be able to

1. Create a Voice Recording
2. Automatically transcribed into text and added to a new page in Notion
3. From that text leverage AI to automatically synthesize key points, a summary, as well as automated tagging for these ideas

This way I'm able to much better organize my Personal Knowledge Management within Notion and be able to act on some of these random ideas that pop up.
